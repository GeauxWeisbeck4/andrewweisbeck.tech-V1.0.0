# Introduction

Welcome to my collection of pomdoro docs! I say pomodoro and not pomodoro timer because I am building off of the Pomodoro concept to make a little workflow that keeps me focused and on track. This is my first strategy I'm implementing for my Moon Buddhas app and creating a [Geauxmodoro (Pomodoro) Timer](https://https://geauxmodorotimer.netlify.app) to keep me on task for as long as I want to work on something and then take a break when the timer goes off.

# Philosophy

I often try to get too many things done and get myself into trouble with getting stretched thin. But I found that a. the Pomodoro method is highly effective for me and b. I will be more likely to use something I made, all the time. It provides you with a sense of accomplishment and productivity all-in-one when I create my own Pomodor Timer and then use it to plan and run my day.

# Getting Started

I am following a tutorial for this one, just to get started. I've built one in Python before, but this is my first real native project for JavaScript and React. I also need to get switched over to my Mac so it's easier to take notes. Well, not my Mac, Lisa's work Mac. I'm still trying to get my Mac's out of the computer shop - sorry quick plug here:
