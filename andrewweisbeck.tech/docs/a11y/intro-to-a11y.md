# Introduction to A11y, AKA Accessibility

Accessiblity is a topic that I care a lot about. For one, I have a disability (ADHD, among others) and am very empathetic to those who do as well. I also want to show that there are direct benefits to A11y, other than just following the law and helping out those with disabilities.

I am going to conduct a business case in the coming weeks and just wanted to start laying out some of my own guidelines that I got from [W3c](https://www.w3.org) and info to prepare for it.

## Advantages of Accessiblity
- Drives Innovation: A11y features often solve unanticipated problems
- Enhance Your Brand: Diversity an dinclusion efforts so important to business success are accelerated with a clear, well-integratedaccessibility commitment.
- Extend Market Reach: Global market of people with disabilities is over 1 billion people with a spending power of more than $6 trillion. Accessibility improves UX for everyone.
- Minimize Legal Risk: Won't break the law
