# Welcome to AndrewWeisbeck.tech

This is my official documentation website you could say. I want to try to keep this as a higher level overview of what I'm working with, but still offer good tutorials and resources. 

## Getting Started

You should have gotten here through [GeauxWeisbeck4.dev](https://geauxweisbeck4.dev) or through my GitHub. I mean really, you could have gotten here in any other way. 

To get started, I just want to give some info about my time learning full-stack in the last year, and then I have to jump into building the GeauxWeisbeck4.dev website tutorial. 

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.
- Whatever technology is called for in the project:
  - Frontend, backend, middleware, etc. can be found in the tutorial
  - List of all Featured tech below as well!

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
