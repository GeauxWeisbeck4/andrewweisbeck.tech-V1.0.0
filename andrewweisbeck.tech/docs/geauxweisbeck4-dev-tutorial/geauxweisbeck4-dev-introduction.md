# GeauxWeisbeck4.dev Introduction

This is the 2nd version of my professional website. It really needs a huge full-stack upgrade. I'm not sure what the hell my last website was. This one will be something else - I promise.

I want a full-stack application with music, a dashboard, sports stuff, polls... everything!
