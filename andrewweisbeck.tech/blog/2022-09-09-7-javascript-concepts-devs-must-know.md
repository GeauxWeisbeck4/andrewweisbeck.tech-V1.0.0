We all use JavaScript when we interact with those fun elements on a website. Developers love JavaScript as it is one of the most widely used languages among our kind. [Geeks for Geeks](https://geeksforgeeks.org) created a wonderful post recently on [7 JavaScript Concepts That Every Web Developer Must Know](https://geeksforgeeks.org)/-javascript-concepts-that-every-developer-must-know) that I used for this post.

1. Scope 

Scope esentially means what variables do I have access to? In Javascript by default, your in root scope - window scope. It is simply a box with a boundary for variables, functions, and objects. Must understand that there are boundaries that put restrictions on variables and determines who has access. Limits visibility and must have a clear understanding of concept to help you separate logic in your code and improves readability. 

- Local Scope allows access to everything
- Global Scope - Everything outside the boundaries cannot access a variable defined in a local scope because its enclosed.
